# Q1 End of Lessons Reflection
## List 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences. 

#### 1. **HTML Basic Structure & Tags** -  I am most comfortable with the lesson the lesson on basic HTML structure and tags. This is due to the fact that it follows a simple and easy to understand format as well as not having to be too technical (unlike loops & functions).

#### 2. **Introduction to JavaScript** - Using JavaScript's basic operators, statements,and variables was also an easy topic for me as it is similar to our C++ lessons from last SY. Additionally, I also found it quite easy as I was able to clearly see the flow or structure of the code. 

#### 3. **Inroduction to CSS** - Using different fonts, background colors, and texts for CSS is yet another topic I find easy to understand. I've enjoyed this one particularly as changing the colors (especially for the background) was a great help for me as my eyes hurt from staring at the screen after a few hours (all the more when the background color is white or other bright shades). It was also easy to understand and implement as I found several guides as to what codes to use and how they worked (from W3 Schools) prior to our discussion/s.

#### 4. **HTML Basic Structure & Tags** - I'm quite particular on the lesson on the different HTML tags as the labels of each tag helped me to easily visualize what each of them would execute. Having the AI helper of VSCode was also a great aid in understanding how to use the HTML tags, helping to shorten my code by a notable amount. 

#### 5. **Introduction to Web Development & The Use of HTML** - In relation to my answer in number 4, I also found the introduction to Web Development and the usage of HTML as a whole to be one of the more interesting and easy to understand topics. This is mostly because the bulk of the lesson was conceptual however, I still found it interesting as it provided me an insight into how the internet works today. This realization or insight was further hightened after the first few coding tasks using HTML. 

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

#### 1. **Control Structures** - I'm familiar with our lesson on Control Structures (loops) however, I find it quite difficult to use in practice. The cause of this issue can be found in my unfamiliarity with such lines of code wherein I get confused with what different parts of a loop do. I also realized that among other issues, I have been making rather basic errors with using  the wrong update variables for loops. 

#### 2. **JavaScript Syntax** - I understand the concepts of declaring functions however I am still prone to errors in declaring variables. An example of this issue would be the differences between the usage of const, let, and var. Whereas I can tell when to use const and let, I sometimes get confused in using let and var, only to realize late into my process of writing code that they are practically the same. Overall, I require more practice and familiarity with the different types of variables.

#### 3. **JavaScript Syntax** - Debugging lines of code is yet another one of the concepts I understand but am unable to carry out in practice. The actual execution of the lesson is difficult as to begin with, I have a weak foundation in how loops and functions work, weakening my ability to debug code. An example of this is from our coding task, wherein I was only able to identify mistakes such as an excess of operators or misplaced signs/symbols rather than issues with the actual syntax.  

#### 4. **HTML Basic Structure & Basic Tags** - While I found the lesson on HTML tags to be interesting and easy to understand/execute, I've faced challenges in adding images, textboxes and buttons especially for my coding tasks and website. That being said, I've only been able to decorate it using different font styles and colors (both for text and background). 

#### 5. **Defining Functions & Event Handlers** - Identifying function methods and parameters was and still is rather challenging for me as I am unable to actually use these in practice. I lack the ability to actually use functions properly and debug them as usually these are paired with loops which I am equally not confident in. 


## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

#### I personally plan to practice via CodeChef and try re-doing the coding tasks as I had found many of them to be rather challenging. I also plan to consult my classmates on the aforementioned topics as they have a better grasp of the lesson/s than me. As much as possible, I'm hoping to be able to find some time to advance study the following lessons as I find it difficult to walk into class having little to no knowledge on the topic (especially for CS).



## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### - Effective:

#### 1. Simulations or practice exercise for identifying prioritized operators were helpful as it allowed me to understand as to how to structure my loops and even know when to use parenthesis to simplify code. It served as a well-needed review for me as I was focusing on subjects such as Math and Chem at the time. 

#### 2. Exploring different methods to use functions and loops were useful provided that I was and consider myself to still be quite confused with the usage of such lines of code. 

### - Ineffective:

#### 1. I did not find the Kahoot (conducted with Ma'am Aline) very insightful as it became more of a competition rather than a lesson. I do credit the fact that corrections were made regarding (student) errors in answering the forum and that the activity was fun however, I personally don't find it very helpful.

#### 2. Practices using CodeChef were quite helpful however the pacing was too fast for me to understand some bits of the code. A contributing factor to this (which I had realized quite late) was that I couldn't see part of the code at the lower portions of the projection/screen.
